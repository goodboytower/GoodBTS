# GoodBTS
# April 8th, 2023 - Update! An updated and improved version of this guide has been posted on my blog. Check it out at https://maunedigitalsolutions.com/blog

The most up-to-date repository for Nuand BladeRF and YateBTS compatibility.

If you run into any problems, feel free to leave a message on this page and I'll respond ASAP. I keep pretty good track of my Github, so I should't take too long to respond.

After working through the various issues of multiple sources to implement YateBTS with the BladeRFx40, I decided to create this repository in order to assist other creators with their own implementation in a much more thorough educational guide. I will do my best to avoid gaps in implementation, and add educational pieces where I feel confident in my knowledge. 

This educational guide was written by Michael Maune. A big shoutout to all those who helped and assisted with this project: Giovanni Licamelli, Mohammed Islam, David Miller, "rtucker at Nuand.com", and "Ioana Stanciu at forum.yate.ro".

DISCLAIMER: This guide is only intended for use in educational projects. Using this guide will create a functional Network-In-A-Box (NIB) for personal use. GoodBTS will NOT assist in creating an IMSI Catcher or similar man-in-the-middle functions. Unethical use of the hardware referred to in this guide is ILLEGAL and restricted by the FCC. Please refer to FCC ยง97.313(a) for further guidance on broadcasting in the RF spectrum.
